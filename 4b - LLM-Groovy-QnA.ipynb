On OS X this is /Library/Java/Home, on other unixes its often /usr/java etc. If youâ€™ve already installed tools like Ant or Maven youâ€™ve probably already done this step.\\nYou should now have Groovy installed properly.

Differences with Java\\nGroovy tries to be as natural as possible for Java developers. Weâ€™ve\\ntried to follow the principle of least surprise when designing Groovy,\\nparticularly for developers learning Groovy whoâ€™ve come from a Java\\nbackground.\\nHere we list all the major differences between Java and Groovy.\\n3.2.1. Default imports\\nAll these packages and classes are imported by default, i.e. you do not\\nhave to use an explicit import statement to use them:\\njava.io.*\\njava.lang.*\\njava.math.BigDecimal\\njava.math.BigInteger\\njava.net.*\\njava.util.*\\ngroovy.lang.*\\ngroovy.util.*\\n3.2.2. Multi-methods\\nIn Groovy, the methods which will be invoked are chosen at runtime. This is called runtime dispatch or multi-methods. It\\nmeans that the method will be chosen based on the types of the arguments at runtime. In Java, this is the opposite: methods\\nare chosen at compile time, based on the declared types.\\nThe following code, written as Java code, can be compiled in both Java and Groovy, but it will behave differently:\\nint method(String arg) {\\n    return 1;\\n}\\nint method(Object arg) {\\n    return 2;\\n}\\nObject o = \"Object\";\\nint result = method(o);\\nIn Java, you would have:\\nassertEquals(2, result);', metadata={}),\n",

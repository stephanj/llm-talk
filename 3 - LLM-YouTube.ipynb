in give me a second so you've probably noticed hopefully the movie Will Not Crash tomorrow evening but uh of course we have Top Gun the Maverick uh tomorrow evening at uh at in this room at eight o'clock so make sure you're here we're gonna have free popcorn for everybody so that should be a good one it was actually a bit difficult because um yeah we've moved it to beginning of October for obvious reasons and to be clear it was for the sunshine right um but um yeah all the big blockbuster movies actually get out in December so I had to actually really dig and see which movie it would be and we were able from Sony to still show this one which isn't actually displayed anymore in the cinemas who hasn't seen the movie yet okay so I think there's gonna be enough people I've I've been told it's a really great movie so anyway so welcome to the 19th Edition 19. it's actually 22 years now because we skipped a few years but I just Nicola tweeted like I need to ask who's here for the very first time wow still a lot so well you I'll talk about that later on we had a bit of a rush on the registration tickets and people are telling like yeah but you should have some kind of mechanism to make it more fair so my question is who's been here for 19 Editions one two okay so we'll just use that like you know if you come to all the additions you get pre-registration I think that's going to be easy to solve you know problem solved next up so our um our theme for this here is obviously you know it's strange times that we're living in and I like to focus on the positive things and the positive is of course you know the signs are what smart people can do with technology and we have this you know space web telescope doing circles and having drones as well don't worry about that but I just want to get some exclusive footage but uh on 1.5 million kilometers we have this James Webb Telescope taking pictures of the galaxies and so on and I thought it was so obvious that we should take that as the theme of this year because it does show the positive side of humanity and I wasn't completely convinced until I saw this picture here anybody knows this picture I've seen this you can yell if you want nobody okay because I was actually thinking of getting an astrophysicist doing a keynote and I actually reached out to Dr Kelly she's a lady very smart person in the UK but she could only do an in Virtual talk and I said no I I only want to do in-person talks after three years but this is actually Stefan squintet these are five galaxies you're seeing this is based on 1 000 images that they glued together and these are five galaxies this is just amazing I mean I'm sure there must be other species intelligent life out there I mean we can't be the only human beings out there so anyway that's that's our theme of this year it's basically all the the images from space web telescope so we had two editions skipped because of Corona I really didn't want to do a virtual event because people just get frustrated you sit there in your pajama doing a talk and you have no feedback I really hated that I did work one year uh well the first year was like it's about to go right but you couldn't go on holidays so it's like well that's not really uh that fun um and then the second year together with celestino we developed an online platform for like the different devoxes who did want to do an online event uh like devox Ukraine devox UK a few Vox days as well so we actually had lots of fun but after the second year I was like I'm bored I want to organize devops you know so for me it's like it's clear now I mean I'll be organizing devops for the rest of my life until I drop debts basically because I love doing this right so you should be okay um of course if I drop that tomorrow it's finished right so but if you look at it it's been three years basically and it was obviously from the beginning that people really want to get back into person events so we were assuming or we were anticipating that it would sell out fast and I will be so for devops France I think it was 11 hours Nicola 11 hours they've experience was so loud so we said like I was guessing like three days and but I said like just to play it safe we'll do two batches so we had one batch of 2000 tickets and another batch of 750 tickets and of course there's a lot of other extra tickets out just to give you the real number we are with 3200 unique developers here uh during the week so so that's the total number um and so we said the first batch we open it up we use the a very a nice registration application which I'll talk about later on and there was 1 600 tickets gone in five minutes in five minutes these were all the combi and the Deep dive sorry the combi and the conference tickets those were all gone in five minutes I was like refreshing and the first reflex was oh damn there's a bug in the system but it's an open source platform so I knew it was a battle grounded so I was like what what was happening is like five minutes seriously that's not fair for a lot of people and like Christina and I we were like excited and then in the afternoon we were actually I was actually shaking seriously I was like what's happening this is like it's like a techno event or like Tomorrowland people were tweeting it's like what the hell but then the other in the afternoon yeah we started to get calls like companies like I won't say any names but there were like lots of companies like what happens my guy was in the traffic jam he was there at 9 30 and everything was gone so we had to do a bit of damage control and luckily we had the second batch and so we were basically taking some tickets from that and giving it to this about selling it to the sponsors but we need to think about that for next year because I really hope this was just a pandemic effect right next year hopefully it will not go that fast I don't know let's see so but we said like well Christine was like literally going like this and Christine is my wife I mean without her I would not be able to organize this I would have been broke already 10 times right everything would really run in chaos Etc I'm more creative she does all the administration and she's a great great help and my partner in crime so let's give it a close to her as well but uh our printers she she has to print it because we're working with an accountancy which needs to have the paper the printer was really going like that it was like what all day printing the invoices and we're using spigots spigot was running on a kubernetes cluster it it didn't bind I mean it was really nicely scalable so it could handle as many as we want so that that was fine so great job by celestino who also organizes the scanning if you ever want to organize an event you need an open source registration app it's free you can use it it's great products and and I really appreciate Celestino's work so thank you and so we said like even the printer was saying like please cool down Yeah we actually had the taste of the toner in our mouth the first day because we're just printing constantly so that was like Wow and then yeah then of course the phone calls came in and said like well we need more tickets Etc I said no problem no problem we have a second batch we'll have a second back towards it 15 of September no problem uh just just registered there and you'll be fine so in the theme of Top Gun um this wasn't this is what happened and it was gone two seconds and I was like I was refreshing I was like what two seconds how's that possible two seconds so they were really there were no bots so it was real persons actually there was a company with 10 people who were refreshing to make sure they got the ticket so it's like bloody hell so it looks it's obvious everybody wants to be back in an in-person event so again I'm really glad about that I even saw a tweet from Roy it was like it's even harder to get devops tickets than for a Dell and pdas and so on so yeah or Beyonce so but three years I mean three years just imagine three years ago we were at jdk 13. yeah so and and that's a very good thing right because every six months we have a new version so that's really good that's actually not so bad to actually have a small boss because there's a lot of stuff we can talk about I mean if you look at now we are in the JK 19 we've got project Bloom we actually have Ron Pressler who is one of the I think it's a technical lead of project Bloom talking here as well today so make sure you check that talk out but we have so many other things like project Amber Valhalla Panama I know by I gave Simon Ritter an extra talk on the pattern matching as well so the good thing about not doing it for a few years is that there's a lot of content that we can actually provide you which is really fresh Etc um and I I will hope hopefully next year we will get Mark Reynolds back and Brian Getz to talk here as well of course they have their own event next week so that was a bit of a scare I mean I moved it without really looking at the other competition well no not competition but Coco League conquery colleges so but hopefully we'll fix that for next year so a lot for for Java I think for me personally so the first year when I took the sabbatical I actually played with AI and convolutional networks because my son plays basketball and so I I film all his matches and then I'd create like highlights but I wanted to optimate that so during my sabbatical I developed using CNN's a way to actually analyze where the ring is where the ball is and then every time the ball is above the ring that's potentially a highlight and so I was having fun with that but this was like three years ago now the big thing really in Ai and I know it's more we're Java Centric conference but there's a lot of excitement with the Transformers I mean Transformers is a new encoding decoding Paradigm which is basically almost replacing convolutional neural networks and there's a lot of excitement there and especially in the large language models and that's why also I've invited Alan to come and talk about that on the keynote because there's a lot of excitement there and then you say like well what's what's in it for me well you know if you look at all these different tools you have like big code you have codes Geeks the whole open AI codex with gpt3 but then on top of that you have the GitHub co-pilot it is really touching Our Lives as a developer right and where will it take us if you extrapolate this where will it be at 10 years time I mean you saw the video at the in the before the uh the uh the trailer this was completely generated using a prompt there was isn't any artistic designer behind that so they these like designers they're like they're getting scared it's like bloody hell yeah and if you look at co-pilot I mean I can just give a prompt and it creates code for me so it's like what's going to happen as a developer you know in 10 20 years time in 20 years time though I will already drop that so I don't care but for the young young developers like what's going to happen so that's very interesting times and we'll see uh a lot more details are coming up in the Keynotes but also and then there's a few related talks that you should definitely check out okay um and so that's the the AI part if you're interested in doing this type of stuff there's a whole range I mean you've probably heard and already seen this before there's a whole coming too fast there's a whole range of interesting Solutions there um I mean I've played with Dali e stable diffusion disco diffusion this really really crazy stuff that can be done and so coming back to the the video you saw before the trailer is that um I wanted to at least give a few contexts and say like okay these are some subjects we won't touch one is the the drones and of course we have the Drone here where we're playing and getting some new content but the main drone the reason why the Drone was here is that last month we actually had devox Ukraine uh taking place which is an online uh it was an online event of course for obvious reasons um but what is really cool about devox Ukraine last month is that it was based on donations and they actually collected fifty thousand dollars from people including even vanguards who donated and I of course did the same and with that donations they are actually purchasing drones for the Army so you go like wow and I know I know I shouldn't be politically and so on but it's just an insane time and and again uh yeah there's no words for that but uh at least that's a that's a way of helping us so you can still donate if you're interested on the Ukraine devops Ukraine website um the other visual I wanted to have was of course the beer and then and so on you know beer Central who hasn't been at beer Central yet who has not been at beer Central okay 10 has not been at beer Central just a warning Belgian beer does have a bit more alcohol than the beer in the UK so you will and can have a headache you know the next day so watch out those it's don't don't drink too much right um the other vegetable was of course let me see if it is then the the movie and then I thought that was a nice one where we have the the skyline of antwer but also us developers sitting alone in our pajamas you know in front of the computer hacking away and I think another positive thing of the pandemic again I like to see the positive parts of it is that working at home has been really endorsed by our employers by the big companies so I think that's that's definitely a positive sign but being in your pajamas for one year that's that's not a good thing either right I mean I think it's the first time I'm wearing a polo since three years otherwise it was just my t-shirt from whatever sponsor I got the t-shirt from but so it is good to get out once in a while otherwise you get really isolated um so for the people who want to do this art and you want to make your own video there's a few other conferences here who might want to do this type of intro um I got this from David's his Twitter account is marketer paints and he's actually from Down Under as well so our next keynote speaker is from Australia and we have another uh engineer who actually did this video and he's using as you can see all these different uh tools he started with disco diffusion if you've played with disco diffusion it creates more artistic type of paintings and so that wasn't really the best set for him he actually went for stable diffusion and he then runs it on Google collab and on Google call app you get all the gpus that you want you can even have like a pro version for like 10 or something and you have really powerful machines and he actually did about 100 video iterations to create that video so that's pretty uh pretty amazing and he even created five second Indian Rose which we will put in front of the rich presentation makes a lot of noise one other thing I wanted to highlight is this poster I made because again you know I had a bit of free time this was based on a version one which Dave Paul Paul did and it it's like a road map for the Java developers in 2022 you can download it it's open source so you can download the the chart and you can adjust it because it's not perfect I will not say this is it it's a guideline you can customize it because you can just download the keynote file and adjust it but we actually printed a thousands of these posters so if you want to have one we'll put it at the registration desk and you can put it uh you know on your office wall or you can even use it if you're gonna hire some Junior developers you can like you know show like show the maps this is what you all need to know right and scare them and then yesterday I was a student do I need to know everything he said no no no just focus on the small part you don't need to know everything right so make sure you don't scare them off either right but get your copy we will have them at the registration desk and so this year I deliberately decided not to stream the talks because I said like I had enough of this virtual streaming stuff I will do it only on demand because it's also an extra stress as you can see sometimes things can go wrong and with streaming all these talks something can go wrong so I wanted to eliminate that risk so we are recording all of the talks all the talks from Monday are already on our YouTube channel um we will release the talks from yesterday later after the screen Hotel I'll put them public but basically all the talks which are happening in the cinema rooms are made available on our YouTube channel so make sure you don't have to miss anything if there is a room which is full just turn go to another session and then watch that talk later on you know tomorrow or during the weekends when it starts raining again and the the channel is really growing and we have 134 000 people subscribing and I tell that to a lot of speakers like there's some speakers who you know like yesterday there was a few talks which didn't have that many attendees because they were all going to vent cut of course right and said don't worry I mean doing the talk in front of a few people that's totally fine because prime time is online right there are talks which only had a few people and then you have a hundred or two hundred thousand views on on YouTube so even for the speaker you know it is shared with the community and and we make that available for everybody to enjoy so that's where you need to go a bit of information of the proposals just to give you a bit of context we actually received 736 stocks in our cfp and we actually limit it to three talks per speaker if we would not have done that we probably would have had double the talks because a lot of speakers will just say oh I'll just publish or submit all the talks that I can give so we limit that to make it a bit easier for us but we had a 736 stocks so we had a lot of good quality to choose from and I need to thank I'm not I'm sure they're not all here but I really need to thank my program team and uh they're really doing an amazing job not only reviewing talks but like helping me with the registration with moving boxes around Etc I mean again it is a team effort even if I'm the only one standing here it is a really team effort and I would like to give you you know let's let's give them a round of applause for their support right and the beauty is is that we actually don't only use our program team but we actually because it was a bit in the wrong sequence normally we allow people to register and then the people who register get access to the proposals and they can also rate the talks but this year we had the cfp first and then I only had the registration in August because I wanted to at least see where covet would be because I was really like if kovit would still have been high I would not have organized the event either right um so luckily that wasn't the case but that that meant I had to actually reach out to you say hey who wants to actually review talks and we have a lot of people I think the first two columns they they all reviewed all the talks that's like bloody hell that's a lot not even the program team does all the talks except I think geomitz did but that's like so again it's a group effort we get like 40 50 people who review and then for me as a program chair it's very easy it's just I go to all the top rated talks and basically select these and that makes my life very easy and then I use optaplanner to actually generate a schedule for me and then FF speaker comes to me and says why do I speak on Friday so that's not me it's it's OCTA planner it's Joffrey's fault he he did the the the algorithms behind that so thank you again for for that I really really appreciate it it is a really Community effort and we try our best to to provide you some some good experiences and good talks um of course the the the other big part for us is the speakers we have about roughly around 230 speakers and I was really scared I know Arno who does the devops France he's also the program chair in Paris I think he had about eight or ten speakers dropping out in was it April or May because of kovitz so I was like man I really was anticipating like don't give too many talks to one speaker because if he or she drops out you know I need to find replacements and we only had one person who had uh kovitz so that's like positive signs so that's really good so uh so thank you thank you very much to all the speakers and we had a really nice reception yesterday evening and you just saw the enthusiasm the fact that we could hug each other again sure we'll probably be sick next week maybe or a few that it's bound to be we will have a bit of snots and but at least we won't die from it right I mean I think we're all at the stage where we get vaccinated and we're fine uh so I I hope so of course but again thank you to all the speakers of making this happen again without them it would not be possible and of course the last part is our our sponsors um you know Amazon jet brains thank you for your support I mean I'm I love Jade I use it on a daily basis so it's really great to have them here and if you have different technical issues you can talk to the engineers there and they're doing an amazing job even Amazon they I don't know if you know this but they have something called code Whisperer and goat Whisperer is their solution to cooked well or their alternative to co-pilots so all these big companies are starting to do the same thing where they generate codes based on prompts so make sure you check it out as well once it's available and again there's there's quite a few new ones as well companies like diff blue is an interesting one I'll definitely going to play with that they didn't pay me to tell this I'm just I'm speaking from the heart here but they basically have an algorithm where you can install a plugin in your IDE and it will show you an icon to actually generate a unit test based on that methods but a smart unit test so I'm definitely going to play with that and I you know I want to reach like 80 coverage because now it's zero so I need to do something about that and clean up my acts but thank you again for all these companies supporting us you can make sure you visit them say hello look at what they provide us Etc I mean they will definitely appreciate that so that's all good and we also have something new which Christine came with is uh we have this movie bar so at the exit well where you go upstairs left and right you will see three bikes and so there you can just sit on the bike and produce your own smoothie with your own energy right so make sure you check it out it's really nice movies and so like yesterday it was really funny venkat was doing a three-hour Deep dive and then in the afternoon he had to do another three three hours Deep dive and you would think like he's going to be exhausted right so during lunch I was going to this movie bar guess who was biking like a crazy first Cuts it's like come on he's a Superman or what is that I mean that's not fair but the beauty was is I was actually drinking his juice I was like well thank you Japan got again for your energy and I was like it was really nice movie but so make sure you check that out um and every day we actually have a different sponsor next to it who basically sponsors the the fruit uh which they offer so so thanks for that that's that's a nice addition this evening we'll have the meet and greet so because we're in Belgium we will have beer and french fries for the people who are here for the first time so in the exhibition Hall I think till around 8 8 30 you'll be able to drink some beer french fries socialize and yes we we put mayonnaise on our french fries and then we go all the way so you need to have like mayonnaise in your hand that's that's how Belgium's do it and then you lick it off and then you give a hand and say hey how are you that's that's normal it's tradition but thank you to Google Sona type and jfrog for supporting and sponsoring that it's really good because I don't want to bore you with the finances but like the catering for us it was 50 more expensive compared to three years ago 50 and um but you know electricity is also like involved it's so I really hope I won't get a second invoice afterwards will be placed out for the Stream two last points I wanted to bring over um stay in Vanden from RCR and a few other colleagues they're organizing actually a fox days Brussels um he wanted to do this in may like be the first one before kovitz but it was just too aggressively from a timing perspective so they rescheduled it to the 23rd of May 2023 so if you are from from Belgium it's I mean Vox day is for the people who don't know this these are like the incubators for devox so there's basically an event from java user groups who organize a one day or a two-day event and a few of those their aim is to become a devoxx now of course here it's a bit of a special situation because we already have a devops um but yeah it's it's uh it will be in in Brussels brussels.voxdays.com and the ticket sales already open and it is a one-day event to just get together and at least you know we sometimes get some I call it the devox blues so like we work nine months to this event and then on Monday I more or less fall in a depression for a week or so because you just missed this energy Etc so luckily in May I can just get it up again and then go back and then socialize so I'm looking forward to that so staying all best best of luck with organizing this and then next year it's our 20th Edition 20th so we're brainstorming about what else we can do and we hopefully we'll come up with a few interesting things um but I think my main focus will be just to make sure the movie trailer prays completely I think that will be my main focus for the 20th Edition but other than that the dates is important to know so I've actually decided to move it even one week sooner so it will be from the second till the 6th of October and again the main reason is to be in front of the covet Spike because we are still starting to see that it's picking up again so if we're getting closer to the summer the closer to the summer the safer we will be so the second to the sixth and I think registrations will be open or we will open it around may we will definitely communicate about communicate it good enough and we will work again with two batches and just please just take your time to register you'll be fine you know like okay should be good anyway that's me so it's my pleasure now to [Music]\"\n",

He has also noticed a rush on tickets and is asking who has attended 19 editions and suggesting they get pre-registration. The theme of this event is to focus on the positive use of technology and how smart people can use it.\n",
      "\n",
      " A keynote speaker from the UK was going to do a virtual talk, but was declined in favour of a physical event. The theme of the event is based on the 1.5 million kilometers of exclusive footage taken by the James Webb Telescope, which showed five galaxies glued together from 1,000 images. After two years of virtual events due to COVID-19, the speaker decided to return to physical events as they preferred to have feedback and not sit in their pajamas. It is their intention to continue organizing devops events for the rest of their life.\n",

      " DevOps France had 3200 unique developers attend the event and tickets sold out in 5 minutes. They had two batches of tickets, 2000 in the first batch and 750 in the second batch. Companies called in to ask what happened and they needed to do damage control, so they took some tickets from the second batch and gave it to the sponsors. They need to consider this for next year.\n",

      " This account details the event-planning process of Christine and her partner Celestino, including the use of open-source registration app, a Kubernetes cluster-based printer, and a second batch of tickets released on 15 September.

      "This speaker has been attending the JDK conference for three years and they are now on version 19. They have a lot of new content to provide, such as Project Bloom, Project Amber, Valhalla, Panama, and Pattern Matching. The speaker also took a sabbatical three years ago and used convolutional neural networks to create highlights of basketball games. AI is now the big thing, even at this Java-Centric conference.\n",

      "Transformers is a new encoding-decoding Paradigm that is replacing convolutional neural networks and is quickly gaining excitement amongst developers. GitHub Co-Pilot is one example of this technology that is changing how developers work, and it can be seen in the video generated using a prompt. There are a variety of other solutions, such as Dali, e-stable diffusion, and disco diffusion, that are creating interesting solutions for developers.\n",

      " Last month, Devox Ukraine held an online event which raised fifty thousand dollars in donations, some of which were used to purchase drones for the army. Additionally, Beer Central was mentioned as a warning that Belgian beer has more alcohol than UK beer, and there was a visual of developers in their pajamas hacking away. Another positive from the pandemic is that working from home has been endorsed by employers.\n",

The YouTube channel is growing, with 134,000 subscribers, and the talks from Monday are already up. There were 736 proposals for talks and they limited it to three talks per speaker. The talks, even if there are only a few attendees, can have hundreds of thousands of views.\n",

      " The program team and around 40-50 people helped review 736 stocks to choose from for the event. The registration was held in August after the CFP had been released to assess the impacts of Covid-19. Optaplanner was then used to create a schedule for the event, with Joffrey creating the algorithms behind it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This speaker appreciates the community effort in providing good experiences and talks. There were roughly 230 speakers and only one had Covid-19, so it was a positive sign. The speaker thanked the speakers and sponsors, particularly Amazon and JetBrains. Finally, the speaker mentioned companies like DiffBlue that offer alternative solutions to coding.\n",

After two years of virtual events due to COVID-19, they decided to return to physical events. The event was popular and sold out in two seconds. They discussed Project Bloom, Project Amber, Transformers, GitHub Co-Pilot, Dali, e-stable diffusion, and disco diffusion. They also mentioned Devox Ukraine and Beer Central, as well as the YouTube channel they have with 134,000 subscribers. They thanked the speakers, sponsors, and companies like DiffBlue. Finally, they announced Vox Days Brussels in May 2023 and the 20th Edition of a movie trailer project in October.'"
